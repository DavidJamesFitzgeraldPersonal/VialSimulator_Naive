The point of the simulation seems a little awkward - If my flow chart is correct then the behaviour of the system is very predictable. Added parameters such as balance error 
and flowrate to simulate errors and timing!

0. TDD and MVVM would be nice!
1. Assume that racks are "dumb" they cannot tell the state of a vial
2. Do you grind before you know outptut vials are available ? Risk in grinding product with nowhere for it to go !
3. Assume weight of an input vial is known (approximately) as they start with samples in. Can use this to know if sufficient product has been ground.
4. Assume an input vial can be placed on the balance (though this is not actually stated) which allows for measurement of input product.
5. Assume that the number of output vials can be divided by input vials such that there is no remainder (O % I = 0).
6. There is an assumption here that the combinations of target output weight and division factor will all magically work. Not known until an input weight is specified!
7. Do not allow a Target Output Weight of greater than Balance Error to be specified.
